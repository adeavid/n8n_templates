## Clone Viral TikToks with AI Avatars & Auto-Post
- Link: https://n8n.io/workflows/4110-clone-viral-tiktoks-with-ai-avatars-and-auto-post-to-9-platforms-using-perplexity-and-blotato/
- What it does: Accepts a viral TikTok link, reverse-engineers the narrative, regenerates the script via Perplexity + GPT-4o, produces a new avatar-led video, and syndicates it to nine channels via Blotato.
- Why it’s advanced: Mixes competitive intelligence, AI rewriting, avatar video synthesis, and broad distribution while persisting metadata and status tracking inside Google Sheets.
- Key components: Telegram intake, Perplexity search call, OpenAI rewrite, Captions.ai avatar generation, JSON2Video overlay builder, Google Sheets logging, Blotato mass posting.
- Prerequisites: Perplexity API key, OpenAI key, Captions.ai account, Google Sheets credentials, Blotato access (self-hosted n8n community node).
- Reusable building blocks: TikTok media ingestion & transcription, knowledge-augmented prompting (Perplexity), JSON2Video caption overlays, shared sheet-based campaign ledger.

## Automate Content Publishing to TikTok via Blotato
- Link: https://n8n.io/workflows/7187-automate-content-publishing-to-tiktok-youtube-instagram-facebook-via-blotato/
- What it does: Watches a Google Sheet for queued posts, pulls assets from Drive, routes them through Blotato, and posts automatically to TikTok and other short-form networks while updating statuses.
- Why it’s advanced: Provides a governance-first scheduling model with throttling (one post per run), centralized content state, and clean separation of asset storage versus publishing.
- Key components: Schedule trigger, Google Sheets read (pending posts), Google Drive file fetch + permission update, Blotato upload node, Sheets status write-back.
- Prerequisites: Blotato API (self-hosted community node), Google Workspace credentials, Drive folder with public-share toggle, self-hosted n8n.
- Reusable building blocks: Sheet-driven publishing queues, Blotato posting wrapper, Drive media fetcher, idempotent status updates to avoid double-posting.

## TikTok Analytics Monitor with RapidAPI & Google Sheets
- Link: https://n8n.io/workflows/6516-template-for-tiktok-rapidapi-and-google-sheets-services/
- What it does: Runs on a schedule to pull performance metrics for multiple TikTok usernames through a RapidAPI TikTok endpoint and appends refreshed stats to Google Sheets.
- Why it’s advanced: Eliminates the need for TikTok business credentials while still logging per-profile KPIs; uses batch processing and sheet appends designed for scaling agency rosters.
- Key components: Cron trigger, Google Sheets read for usernames, SplitInBatches loop, RapidAPI HTTP requests, Set node normalization, Sheets append.
- Prerequisites: RapidAPI TikTok API key (`tiktok-api42`), Google Sheets credentials.
- Reusable building blocks: Split-in-batches looping, API key rotation pattern, normalized analytics schema for dashboards, daily diffing readiness.

## BONUS: TikTok Post Scraper via Keywords (Bright Data + Sheets)
