## 3. Advanced Triggers & Automation

### 3.1 Behavioral Triggers
Modern drip campaigns respond to specific user actions:

- **Page visits**: Specific product/service pages
- **Content engagement**: Video watch time, downloads

- **Purchase behavior**: First purchase, repeat purchases, spending thresholds
- **Milestone events**: Anniversary dates, birthday, subscription renewal
- **Inactivity**: Days since last login, unopened emails

### 3.2 Time-Based Triggers
- Days since signup/purchase
- Specific dates (holidays, events)
- Scheduled intervals (weekly tips, monthly newsletters)
- Optimal send times (AI-predicted based on user behavior)

### 3.3 Combined Trigger Logic
Advanced campaigns use multi-condition triggers:
```
IF (user visited pricing page)
AND (did not purchase)
AND (7 days since visit)
THEN send pricing FAQ email
```
