## Workflow Patterns

### Content Publishing Pattern

Trigger (Schedule/Webhook) → Content Source (Notion/Sheets) → AI Processing (OpenAI) → Format → LinkedIn Node → Status Update
```

### Lead Generation Pattern
```
Trigger → Lead Source → Data Enrichment → AI Scoring → Filter/Sort → Outreach (LinkedIn/Email) → CRM Update
```

### Approval Workflow Pattern
```
Trigger → Content Generation → Format → Email Approval → Wait for Response → Conditional (Approved?) → LinkedIn Post → Status Update
```

## Technical Considerations

### Self-Hosted vs Cloud
- **n8n.cloud:** Limited to official LinkedIn nodes

- **Self-hosted:** More control over rate limits
- **Self-hosted:** Custom node development possible

### HTTP Request Node
- For custom API calls
- Requires API knowledge
- More flexibility than pre-built nodes
- Useful for undocumented endpoints

### Data Processing
- Use Set node for data transformation
- IF node for conditional logic
- Merge node for combining data streams
- Split In Batches for large datasets
